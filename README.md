***UUPS Proxy Implementation*** â€“ An upgradeable smart contract architecture leveraging the EIP-1822 UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern, built with Solidity and integrated with OpenZeppelinâ€™s upgradeable contracts library. This setup enables efficient contract upgrades while minimizing gas costs compared to traditional proxy patterns. It ensures maintainable, secure, and transparent upgradability through an upgradeTo function governed by access control, maintaining state across upgrades without redeployment.

## Features

- Upgradeable Smart Contracts via UUPS pattern.
- State Preservation across upgrades.
- Access-Controlled Upgrades.
- Reduced Gas Costs vs Transparent Proxy.
- Full OpenZeppelin Compatibility.

## Requirements
